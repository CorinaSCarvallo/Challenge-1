# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise's play Fever came close to it's fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to analyze the available date to determine how different campaigns fared in relations to thier launch dates and thier funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted by viewing the raw data, filtering it and selecting the appropriate fields, rows and columns to pull the relevant data that would show how the different campaigns fared in relations to their launch dates and funding goals. Timestamp was required in order to obtain the correct dates/months of the launch dates.
Challenges included ensuring that the correct formulas were entered and errors were avoided.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful campaign was May. Eventhough May was successful it roughly had the same failed campaigns as the months of June, July and August. Worth investigating further to determine the reason.
The month of October had no cancelled campaigns
Aproximately the same number of cancelled campaigns from Jan to Sept and Nov to Dec. It would be good to find out why there were no cancellations in Oct while some campaigns failed in Oct. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Both the successful and failed campaigns received donations in the range of $15000-$19999, $35000-$39999 and $45000-$49999.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The timing of the launch date directly impacts the success of the campaign

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Failed campaigns can bring in the same range of goals but not reach the full goal intended.
Successful campaigns can be run simulanously in order to reach the range goals.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is no data on the reasons why a campaign was successful. This would be helpful in order to determine the best time and approach to the campaign. This could include target groups and registration vs attendance.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Box plot and staking bar graph.
